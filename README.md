Web Layout Project for the Doctor Who Series in Spanish 🌐👩‍💻 Undertaken as an exercise to learn and apply React.js and Next.js, this project focuses on creating the website for the iconic Doctor Who series in Spanish. The goal is to master the use of React.js and Next.js technologies while developing a scalable and efficient web layout.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## WIP

This project is still a work in progress.
